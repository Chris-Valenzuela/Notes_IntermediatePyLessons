    This will be my first "respository" on my new GitHub. I decided to create a new GitHub and try my best to organize my notes and projects in here. My goal is to build a clean (at least to my standards) GitHub.
    As well as familiarize myself with the nature of this tool. 

    This repository are the notes im taking from the "Intermediate Python Tutorials" in the Youtube Series created by "Tech with Tim"
